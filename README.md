# Let's practice some git cases

Look at the branche graph to see branches for different tasks.

## Welcome to 1st cherry-pick task

Imagine, you worked in "dead-brnch" for few days. You had made 2 comments with your changes, but the task became not relevant yesterday. 
So you have checkouted to new branch "relevant_brnch" and started work with it. But the last commit on "dead_brnch" contains some refactoring that could be useful in master_cp_1.

We need to add all changes from relevant_brnch and useful commit from dead_brnch to master_cp_1.
And don't forget about "pretty commit history". master_cp_1 should contain only one new commit, after all.
